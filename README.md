[&lt;/&gt;](https://github.com/fairybow/fairybow.github.io) by me, using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), HTML, Javascript (with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)), and CSS.

The CSS made tolerable (even fun?) with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## I've also used:
- [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) javascript library, for parsing and loading markdown;
- GitHub & LinkedIn icons by [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) (warning: load time);
- [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/) by [Abbie Gonzalez](https://www.patreon.com/opendyslexic);
- Material Icons (and other fonts) by [Google](https://fonts.google.com/);
- and &ldquo;A red, blue and green fluid painting on a black background&rdquo; by the United States Geological Survey (via [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-red-blue-and-green-fluid-painting-on-a-black-background-hoS3dzgpHzw)).

[&lt;/&gt;](https://github.com/fairybow/fairybow.github.io) by me, using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), HTML, Javascript (with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)), and CSS.

The CSS was made tolerable (even fun?) thanks to [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## I've also used:

### Libraries
- [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) javascript library, for parsing and loading markdown;

### Fonts
- <span id="Aleo">&ldquo;Aleo&rdquo;</span> by [Alessio Laiso](https://alessiolaiso.com/) (via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/));
- <span id="OpenDyslexic">&ldquo;[OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/)&rdquo;</span> by [Abbie Gonzalez](https://www.patreon.com/opendyslexic);
- <span id="Source-Sans-3">&ldquo;Source Sans 3&rdquo;</span> by Paul D. Hunt (via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/));
- [Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) by Google;

### Assets
- GitHub & LinkedIn icons by [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) (warning: load time!);
- and &ldquo;A red, blue and green fluid painting on a black background&rdquo; by the United States Geological Survey (via [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-red-blue-and-green-fluid-painting-on-a-black-background-hoS3dzgpHzw)).
